### ELI5
Smartsheet automations act like little robots that push buttons for you â€” sending alerts, filling forms, or updating rows when something changes.

### Grown-Up
Smartsheet automations enable rule-based workflows for approvals, reminders, and data updates. By combining triggers (form submissions, date changes) with actions (alerts, row movement), teams can streamline compliance, onboarding, and reporting processes. At my job, such automations reduced visitor processing time by over 50%.
