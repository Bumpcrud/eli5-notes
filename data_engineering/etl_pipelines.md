### ELI5
ETL is like moving books from one library to another â€” you take them out (Extract), fix and organize them (Transform), then shelve them neatly (Load).

### Grown-Up
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) defines the flow of data from source systems to target databases or warehouses. Extraction gathers raw data, transformation standardizes and cleans it, and loading inserts it into a structured destination for analytics. Automating ETL improves data integrity and timeliness.
