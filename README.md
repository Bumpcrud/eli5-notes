# ELI5 Notes

A living “explain-like-I’m-five” notebook for my learning in data science, statistics, and analytics.

Each note breaks a complex topic into:
- 🧒 **ELI5 explanation** — a plain-language summary anyone can grasp.
- 🎓 **Grown-up explanation** — a more technical description for reports or coursework.

## 🗂️ Categories
- `python/` — syntax, libraries, and tips (e.g., list comprehensions, pandas, Flask)
- `statistics/` — models and metrics (logistic regression, p-values, R²)
- `data_engineering/` — ETL, data marts, pipelines, and warehousing

## 🧠 Purpose
I’m using this repo to:
- Reinforce my coursework in UW-Green Bay’s Data Science M.S.
- Build quick-reference guides for UTMB analytics and reporting.
- Create a public portfolio of how I learn and explain technical concepts.

## 🚀 How to Use
